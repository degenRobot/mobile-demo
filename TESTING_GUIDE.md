# Testing Guide for Gasless FrenPet Mobile App

## Prerequisites
- Node.js installed
- ~~0.001 ETH~~ **NOTHING! Users need 0 ETH!**

## ðŸŽ‰ ZERO ETH REQUIRED - Truly Gasless!

**Porto relay pays for EVERYTHING, including initial delegation!**

## Quick Test Instructions

### 1. ~~Get Test ETH~~ NOT NEEDED!

**You DON'T need any ETH!** Porto relay handles everything.

### 2. Run Zero-ETH Test (Recommended)

```bash
cd tests
node test-zero-eth-gasless.js
```

This test proves users need 0 ETH:
1. Creates fresh wallet with 0 balance
2. Sets up Porto delegation (FREE)
3. Creates pet (FREE)
4. All gas paid by Porto relay!

### 3. Run Mobile Flow Test

```bash
cd tests
node test-mobile-gasless.js
```

This test simulates the complete mobile app flow:
1. Generates wallet and session key (0 ETH)
2. Sets up Porto delegation (FREE via Porto)
3. Creates pet (GASLESS)
4. Feeds pet with session key (GASLESS)
5. Plays with pet with session key (GASLESS)

- Users need **0 ETH** - not even for initial setup!
- Porto relay pays for all gas including delegation
- No wallet funding required ever

### âœ… Non-Payable Functions
- `createPet()` - Free (no value needed)
- `feedPet()` - Free (no value needed)
- `playWithPet()` - Free (no value needed)

## Mobile App Testing

### Run Jest Tests
```bash
cd mobile
npm test
```

Tests include:
- Contract configuration tests
- Gasless flow integration tests
- Session key management tests
- Game state tests

### Start Mobile App
```bash
cd mobile
npm start
# Then press 'i' for iOS or 'a' for Android
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Transaction on Explorer**
   - Search for transaction hash
   - Verify "From" is relay wallet: `0x584B5274765a7F7C78FDc960248f38e5Ad6b1EDb`
   - Verify user paid no gas

2. **Check Pet State**
   ```bash
   cast call 0x3FDE139A94eEf14C4eBa229FDC80A54f7F5Fbf25 \
     "hasPet(address)(bool)" YOUR_ADDRESS \
     --rpc-url https://testnet.riselabs.xyz
   ```

3. **Get Pet Stats**
   ```bash
   cast call 0x3FDE139A94eEf14C4eBa229FDC80A54f7F5Fbf25 \
     "getPetStats(address)" YOUR_ADDRESS \
     --rpc-url https://testnet.riselabs.xyz
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds" error
- This is NOT because user needs ETH!
- It's likely rate limiting from rapid requests
- Wait 10-15 seconds and retry
- Check Porto relay status

### Transaction fails intermittently
- Porto relay has rate limiting
- Wait 10-15 seconds between transactions
- The user still has 0 ETH - it's a relay issue

### Pet not showing
- Wait for blockchain confirmation (10 seconds)
- Refresh the app
- Check transaction on explorer

## Success Criteria

âœ… User has 0 ETH throughout entire flow  
âœ… All transactions sent by relay wallet  
âœ… Session keys work independently  
âœ… Mobile app shows "Free! ðŸŽ‰" for actions  
âœ… No wallet funding ever required

## The Magic of Porto

Porto handles the complexity:
1. **Delegation Storage**: Porto stores delegation off-chain
2. **First Transaction**: Includes both delegation + user action
3. **Relay Execution**: Porto relay executes and pays
4. **User Experience**: Completely gasless from day one!
